# Open_images_V6_MASK_R_CNN
This code was produced based on matterport/Mask_RCNN. 

Learn using Open images V6. This code was produced for the Kaggle competition 'Open Images Instance Segmentation RVC 2020 edition'.

pre_ano.csv is a pre-processed csv file. In other words, it has only 300 classes required for the competition.

I haven't studied it to the end due to the limitations of the graphics card, but I have confirmed that it works well in the middle.

Personal thoughts and feedback are always welcome.
